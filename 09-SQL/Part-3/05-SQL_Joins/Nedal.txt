The different types of Joins:

A Inner Join B: Only the records in Table A that are matched with records in Table B will be included.
A Left Join B: All the records in Table A and only the records in Table B that are matched to records in Table A. Some records in Table may have missing values from Table B.
A Right Join C : All the records in Table B + only the records in Table A that are matched to records in Table B. Some records in Table B may have missing values from Table A.
A Full Join B: All the records in A and all the records in B whether they match or not.

Part 2:
This is a left join becuase all the records in the Vendor Tables are included despite one record not having a matching value in the Yarn table.
