# Joins Are From Descartes, Rows Are From Schemas


### Part 1

* The outputs of following queries are 25 and 10, respectively.

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM first_table;

  SELECT COUNT(*)
  FROM second_table;
  ```

* What will be the number of rows in the output of the following query?

  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM first_table, second_table;
  ```  
 * The total number of rows would be (25*10)= 250

### Part 2

* The query `SELECT * FROM table_one;` returns the following:

* And the query `SELECT * FROM table_two;` returns the following:

* What will the query `SELECT * FROM table_one, table_two;` look like?

* _You can use pgAdmin and create a new table to test out this activity_

For each row in Table 1, it will run with the rows in Table 2 so:
     1 10
     1 11
     1 12
     2 10
     2 11
     2 12
     :
     :
     4 10
     4 11
     4 12
